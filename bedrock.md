### 1️⃣ Foundation Models (FMs)

**What it is:**  
Pre-trained large AI models (text, image, and multimodal) that serve as the base for generative AI applications.

**Used for:**
- Chatbots and conversational AI
- Text generation
- Summarization
- Translation and classification
- Image generation and understanding

🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“General-purpose pre-trained models” → **Foundation Models**

---

### 2️⃣ Fine Tuning

**What it is:**  
Customizing a foundation model using domain-specific or task-specific data to improve performance and relevance.

**Used for:**
- Adapting tone and responses for business use cases
- Improving accuracy for specialized vocabularies
- Aligning outputs to domain requirements

🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“Customize model behavior with your data” → **Fine Tuning**

---

### 3️⃣ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**What it is:**  
An architecture pattern that combines foundation models with external data retrieval to ground responses in factual context.

**Used for:**
- Knowledge-based question answering
- Document-aware chatbots
- Summarization using proprietary data

🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“LLM + retrieved context” → **RAG**

---

### 4️⃣ Knowledge Bases / Vector Databases

**What it is:**  
Systems that store embeddings (vector representations of text) to enable semantic search and similarity-based retrieval.

**Used for:**
- Retrieval in RAG workflows
- Semantic document search
- Matching queries to relevant content

🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“Store and search data by meaning” → **Vector Databases**

---

### 5️⃣ Optimizing Embedding Vectors

**What it is:**  
Techniques to improve the quality, performance, and cost-efficiency of embeddings used for retrieval.

**Used for:**
- Improving retrieval relevance
- Reducing latency in vector searches
- Scaling semantic search efficiently

🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“Improve retrieval accuracy and performance” → **Embedding Optimization**

---

### 6️⃣ Guardrails

**What it is:**  
Constraints and controls applied to prompts and model outputs to enforce safety, compliance, and quality.

**Used for:**
- Content moderation
- Preventing harmful or biased outputs
- Enforcing policy and response rules

🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“Control and safeguard model outputs” → **Guardrails**

---

### 7️⃣ Prompt Engineering

**What it is:**  
The practice of designing prompts to guide foundation models toward accurate, reliable, and relevant responses.

**Used for:**
- Zero-shot and few-shot prompting
- Structuring instructions and context
- Reducing hallucinations

🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“Guide the model through well-designed input” → **Prompt Engineering**

---

### 8️⃣ Bedrock Prompt Flows

**What it is:**  
A Bedrock capability for orchestrating multi-step prompts with conditional logic and structured reasoning.

**Used for:**
- Complex prompt workflows
- Conditional branching based on model output
- Multi-step reasoning pipelines

🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“Multi-step prompt orchestration” → **Bedrock Prompt Flows**

---

### 9️⃣ Enterprise Integration

**What it is:**  
Patterns and best practices for integrating Bedrock and GenAI services into enterprise AWS environments securely.

**Used for:**
- IAM-based access control
- VPC and network isolation
- Logging, auditing, and compliance

🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“Secure, scalable enterprise GenAI deployment” → **Enterprise Integration**
