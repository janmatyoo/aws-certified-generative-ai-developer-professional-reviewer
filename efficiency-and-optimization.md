### 1️⃣ Context Management – Token Efficiency

**What it is:**  
Strategies to minimize token usage while preserving response quality in Generative AI applications.

**Used for:**
- Reducing prompt size and cost
- Managing conversation history
- Limiting retrieved context in RAG
- Improving latency and throughput

🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“Reduce token usage without losing quality” → **Context Management**

### 2️⃣ Model Selection

**What it is:**  
Choosing the most appropriate foundation model based on quality, latency, cost, and use case requirements.

**Used for:**
- Balancing accuracy vs cost
- Selecting models for real-time vs batch inference
- Matching model capabilities to business needs

🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“Best tradeoff between cost, latency, and quality” → **Model Selection**
