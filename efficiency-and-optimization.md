### 2️⃣ Model Selection

**What it is:**  
Choosing the most appropriate foundation model based on quality, latency, cost, and use case requirements.

**Used for:**
- Balancing accuracy vs cost
- Selecting models for real-time vs batch inference
- Matching model capabilities to business needs

🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“Best tradeoff between cost, latency, and quality” → **Model Selection**

### 3️⃣ Resource Utilization and Throughput

**What it is:**  
Efficient use of compute and inference capacity to handle request volume and concurrency.

**Used for:**
- Scaling inference workloads
- Managing request concurrency
- Avoiding throttling and underutilization

🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“Handle high request volume efficiently” → **Throughput Optimization**

---

### 4️⃣ Caching

**What it is:**  
Reusing previously generated responses or retrieved data to reduce repeated model invocations.

**Used for:**
- Caching embeddings
- Caching LLM responses
- Reducing latency and cost

🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“Reuse results instead of re-invoking models” → **Caching**

---

### 5️⃣ Building Responsive and Resilient AI Systems

**What it is:**  
Designing GenAI applications that remain available, responsive, and fault-tolerant under varying conditions.

**Used for:**
- Timeouts and retries
- Fallback models or responses
- Graceful degradation

🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“System must stay available even during failures” → **Resilient Design**

---

### 6️⃣ Optimizing Foundation Model System Performance

**What it is:**  
Techniques to improve inference performance at the model and system level.

**Used for:**
- Reducing inference latency
- Controlling generation parameters
- Selecting appropriate inference modes (on-demand vs provisioned)

🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“Improve model performance without retraining” → **FM Optimization**

---

### 7️⃣ Resource Allocation Systems

**What it is:**  
Mechanisms that allocate compute and inference capacity dynamically based on workload demands.

**Used for:**
- Managing bursty traffic
- Ensuring consistent performance
- Cost-efficient scaling

🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“Dynamically scale inference capacity” → **Resource Allocation**

---

### 8️⃣ Bedrock Cross-Region Inference
