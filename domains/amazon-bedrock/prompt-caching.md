### Prompt Caching

**What it is:**  
Caching frequently reused prompt context (and/or responses) so repeated requests can be served faster with less repeated foundation model work.

Prompt caching for frequently asked questions and common inquiry patterns can improve response times and reduce the load on an FM. This configuration is especially useful for a customer service system where many queries are likely to be repetitive.


**Used for:**
- Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
- Repetitive inquiry patterns in customer service
- Improving latency and reducing repeated FM load


🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“Repeated prompts/FAQs + cache” → **Prompt caching**
