### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**What it is:**  
An architecture pattern that combines foundation models with external data retrieval to ground responses in factual context.

You can use RAG knowledge bases to pull in up-to-date product catalog + customer data, which improves accuracy and relevance by grounding responses in company-specific context. Keep the knowledge base current by regularly removing outdated product data.


**Used for:**
- Knowledge-based question answering
- Document-aware chatbots
- Summarization using proprietary data


🧠 **Exam cue:**  
“LLM + retrieved context” → **RAG**
