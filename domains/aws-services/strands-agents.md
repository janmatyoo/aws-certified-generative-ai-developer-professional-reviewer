Strands Agents
- an open-source Python SDK (software development kit) for building autonomous, intelligent AI agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) to reason, plan, and use tools
- a framework that can compose and orchestrate multiple specialized GenAI agents
- can streamline the orchestration of multi-agent patterns that would be too difficult or cumbersome to implement through a single agent


**Used for:**
- Organizations that build on AWS infrastructure who want native integration with AWS services for autonomous workflows
- Teams that require enterprise-grade security, scalability, and compliance features for production autonomous systems
- Projects that need flexibility in model selection across different providers for specialized autonomous tasks
- Use cases that require tight integration with existing AWS workflows and resources for end-to- end autonomous processes
